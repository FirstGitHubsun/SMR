# SMR

SMR, i.e, Submodular Maximization Rewriting Scheme, is a cost-efficient rewriting scheme to improve restore performance in deduplication systems.

# The SMR paper

Jie Wu, Yu Hua, Pengfei Zuo and Yuanyuan Sun, "A Cost-efficient Rewriting Scheme to Improve Restore Performance in Deduplication Systems".

# Implementation

We use the interfaces in [Destor](https://github.com/fomy/destor) and make some revisions to implement SMR and support C++. 

The detailed implementation of SMR scheme is in the code file `destor-smr/src/smr_rewrite.cpp`.

The compared rewriting schemes in SMR papers are implemented in the code files `destor-smr/src/cap_rewrite.cpp` and `destor-smr/src/ned_rewrite.cpp`.

# Environment

Linux 64bit.

# Dependencies

1. libssl-dev is required to calculate sha-1 digest;
2. GLib 2.32 or later version

# Installation

If all dependencies are installed, compiling destor is straightforward:

> ./configure

> make

> make install

# Running

The `rebuild` script should be run before destor to prepare working directory and clear data.

The default working path is in `destor.config`. You can modify it together with the rebuild script. 

You can do the following steps to backup and restore the backup stream.

1. start a backup task,

   > destor /backup_stream_directory

   Example: `destor /home/data/`

2. start a restore task,

   > destor -r$backup_job_id$ /restore_direstory

   Example: `destor -r0 /home/restore/ `

# Configuration

A sample configuration is shown in destor.config

The default rewriting scheme is SMR. The SMR level in `destor.config` is adjustable according to the demand of restore performance.
